### Questions
I'm always interested in thoughts on whether there is a point in learning any this given the state of AI, or how we should adapt what we focus on in light of AI. I'm learning frontend coding in the belief that AI code still needs human oversight and I can't provide that oversight without coding proficiency. I wonder if even that will be true in a year though.# newsletter-signup-form
