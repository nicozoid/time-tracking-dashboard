This is a solution to a [challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw).

### Key learnings
First time working with JSON and updating a single page's content dynamically based on user interactions.

### Current process
#### Setup
1. Set up readme.md
1. Import fonts
1. Create JS files and link to it
1. Create CSS file link to it
1. Reset browser default values
1. Add color variables (I'm deliberately ignoring spacing variables for now, to help me practice estimating pixel values)

#### Text classes
1. Set up defaults in body class
1. Define text styles in html and css simultaneously, mobile first
1. Font variations for tablet & desktop

#### Main work
1. Create HTML tags, classes, and id names, focusing on mobile
1. Check HTML will work for tablet and desktop
1. CSS styling for mobile 
1. Define hover states and transitions
1. CSS styling for tablet and desktop
1. JavaScript!

### Questions
I'm learning frontend coding in the belief that AI code still needs human oversight and I can't provide that oversight without coding proficiency. I wonder if even that will be true in a year though. I'm very interested in others' thoughts on this question!
